##  About This Repository

This folder contains all the practice work completed while learning about **Python Classes**. The code examples are based on both structured exercises and personal experiments, all aimed at mastering how classes work in Python.

---

##  Topics Covered

- Defining and instantiating classes
- Creating and using attributes and methods
- The `__init__()` method and `self` keyword
- Modifying attributes directly or through methods
- Inheritance and overriding methods
- Using instances as attributes
- Importing classes from modules
- Building real-world class-based programs

---

## Goals

- Strengthen understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
- Build foundational knowledge for writing modular, reusable code
- Practice through guided examples and custom experimentation

---
